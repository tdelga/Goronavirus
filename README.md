# (Djan)Goronavirus

This project came to life based on the idea to learn React.js and ~~Go~~ Django at the same time in an interesting and interactive way.

The basic idea is to show statistics about the Coronavirus (Formerly known as COVID-19) including active cases, recovered cases, deaths and others in an uncluttered, non-tracking and ad-free way (Just give me the data man!).

All this filtered by region or country if desired.
