# Goronavirus

This project came to life based on the idea to learn React.js and Go at the same time in an interesting and interactive way.

The basic idea is to show statistics about the Coronavirus (Formerly known as COVID-19) including active cases, recovered cases, deaths and others in an uncluttered, non-tracking and ad-free way (Just give me the data man!).

All this filtered by region or country if desired.
